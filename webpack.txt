This is how fucking stupid you are. You cannot throw the constitution out the window when it is convenient for you and then expect the constitution to be invoked when it is about something you disagree with. It sets a precedent which creates the slippery slope to violate individual rights. Legislation must be enforced the same way 100% percent of the time. But let's be real. If you lean towards the left, what you want is to amend the current constitution every time you get "offended". This is the current political/ideological threat against free speech and other individual rights. Quote below.

"The problem with the left is that they only invoke states rights when it is convenient for them. When somewhere like NC says bathrooms are reserved for, you know, people with corresponding genitalia, they want that struck down by federal courts. If conservatives are the only group respecting states rights, it puts them at quite a political disadvantage."
