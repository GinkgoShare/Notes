__Mathematical Symbols__

(=) => The equality symbol means that all that is to the left of = is equal to all that is 
right of =. You can make changes to either side of the equation, but in order to maintain 
the equality of the equation you must make the changes to the opposing side. "For every 
change you apply to the left side of the equation, you must apply the same change to the 
right side of the equation."

One change we can make to an equation is to undo the effects of an operation. If one side 
of the equation has a +4, I can undo this operation by -4. In order to maintain the equality 
of the equation I must also -4 from the other side of the = symbol. This is called applying 
the inverse.

|x| => This notation stands for the absolute value of x. The absolute value of something 
basically means to ignore the sign of the value. So the absolute value of -5 is 5. |-5| = 5.

__Numbers__

Number classifications:

  - The natural numbers: N = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... }
  - The integers: Z = { ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }
  - The rational numbers: Q = { 5/3, 22/7, 1.5, 0.125, -7, ... }
  - The real numbers: R = { -1, 0, 1, √2, e, π, 4.94..., ... }
  - The complex numbers: C = { -1, 0, 1, i, 1+i, 2+3i, ... }
